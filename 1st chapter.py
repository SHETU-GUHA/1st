#Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
   'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
 This expression causes an error because here'I have eaten' and 'burritos' are strings, while 99 is treated as integer. In order to fix the error and print 'I have eaten 99 burritos.', 99 needs '' around it to treat it as a string.
